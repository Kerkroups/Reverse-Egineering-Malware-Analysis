Base 10:

Base 10 includes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Here is 243 in base 10:
243 = (102 * 2) + (101 * 4) + (100 * 3) = 200 + 40 + 3.

Base 7:
243(in base 7) = (72 * 2) + (71 * 4) + (70 * 3) = 98 + 28 + 3 = 129(in decimal).
Base 7 includes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
9 isn't in base 7, so how do we represent it in base 7?
9(in decimal) = (71 * 1) + (70 * 2) = 7 + 2. Our answer is going to be 12(base7) = 9(base10).

Base 2:
Base2/Binary:
What about base 2? Base 2 includes 0 and 1. It works the same as the others. Here are some good values to know:
210 = 1024, 29 = 512, 28 = 256, 27 = 128, etc.

Hexadecimal/Base 16:

BiTS AND BYTES(https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_data_types.htm):
- Bit is one binary digit. Can be 0 or 1.
- Nibble is 4 bits.
- Byte is 8 bits.
- Word is 2 bytes.
- Double Word (DWORD) is 4 bytes. Twice the size of a word.
- Quad Word (QWORD) is 8 bytes. Four times the size of a word.

- Char - 1 byte (8 bits).
- Signed Int:
    16 bit is -32,768 to 32,767.
    32 bit is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
    64-bit is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

- Unsigned Int - Minimum is zero, maximum is twice that of a signed int (of the same size).
- Bool - 1 byte.

BINARY OPERATIONS:

- NOT ("!"): NOT 1 = 0, NOT 0 = 1, !1100 = 0011;
- AND ("&"): 1 AND 1 = 1, 1 AND 0 = 0, 0 AND 0 = 0, 1100 AND 1010 = 1000;
- OR ("|"): 1 OR 1 = 1, 1 OR 0 = 1, 0 OR 0 = 0, 1100 | 1010 = 1110;
- XOR ("^"): 1 XOR 1 = 0, 1 XOR 0 = 1, 0 XOR 0 = 0, 1100 ^ 1010 = 0110;
- NAND: NOT AND;
- NOR: NOT OR;

REGISTERS(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/x64-architecture):
RAX - Known as the accumulator register. Often used to store the return value of a function.
RBX - Sometimes known as the base register, not to be confused with the base pointer. Sometimes used as a base pointer for memory access.
RDX - Sometimes known as the data register.
RCX - Sometimes known as the counter register. Used as a loop counter.
RSI - Known as the source index. Used as the source pointer in string operations.
RDI - Known as the destination index. Used as the destination pointer in string operations.
RSP - The stack pointer. Holds the address of the top of the stack.
RBP - The base pointer. Holds the address of the base (bottom) of the stack.

If the data is too large to fit in a register, a register will hold a pointer to the data so it can be accessed.

RAX is 64 bits, the lower 32 bits can be referenced with EAX, and the lower 16 bits can be referenced with AX. AX is broken down into two 8 bit portions. 
The high/upper 8 bits of AX can be referenced with AH. The lower 8 bits can be referenced with AL.

RAX consists of all 8 bytes which would be bytes 0-7. 
EAX consists of bytes 4-7, AX consists of bytes 6-7, AH consists of only byte 6, and AL consists of only byte 7 (the final byte).

RAX = 0x0123456789ABCDEF
EAX = 0x89ABCDEF
AX = 0xCDEF
AH = 0xCD
AL = 0xEF
